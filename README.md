Starter for Wordpress based small websites for Graffino. Made so it allows to create a working awesome backend as fast as possible.

I usually use Starkers ( https://github.com/viewportindustries/Starkers ) as a starting point since it allows me to work as I please. I don't have anything against other theme starters, just that this allows me to screw things up in my own way.
