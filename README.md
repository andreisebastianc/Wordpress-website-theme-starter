#Starter for Wordpress based small websites for Graffino.
It allows me to create a working awesome wordpress backend as fast as possible.

##How to use
1. download Starkers clean theme ( https://github.com/viewportindustries/Starkers ) and extract to a new folder in wp-theme
2. overwrite folder with repo content
3. build custom post types by following example model and let save of meta be handled by system ( fastes clean way to build custom post types I know without plugins )
4. enable connections between post types if needed ( still in alpha stage but works fine - using it on two projects )
5. create required views by using as much as possible code from commons.php and by creating your own mixins ( example will be posted when I can )

##Personal advice
* contribute
* critique in a reasonable way
* post types should be private by default; make them public when you need them in search
* create a post type for text drop-ins in theme ( will post an example )
